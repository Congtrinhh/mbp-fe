# Post Management Business Context

The Post Management feature enables administrators to effectively moderate and manage MC booking posts within the platform. This feature exists to ensure the quality and appropriateness of all MC booking requests posted on the platform before they become visible to potential MCs.

Administrators need to review and approve posts to prevent inappropriate content, spam, or fraudulent booking requests from appearing on the platform. This moderation process helps maintain the platform's professional standards and protects both MCs and event organizers. The feature includes real-time notifications via WebSocket to provide immediate feedback to users when their posts are approved or deleted, ensuring transparent communication between the platform and its users.

# Admin Layout Business Context

The Admin Layout feature serves as the foundational structure for the administrative side of the MC Booking Platform (MBP). This dedicated interface allows administrators and staff members to efficiently manage platform resources including MCs, client bookings, posts, categories, and user roles.

The need for a separate admin interface stems from the distinct requirements of administrative users compared to regular platform users (MCs and clients). While the main platform focuses on booking interactions, the admin side requires robust management capabilities with quick access to different system resources. By implementing a consistent layout with a sidebar navigation system similar to PrimeVue's Sakai template, we ensure administrators can efficiently navigate between different management sections while maintaining a familiar and professional user experience.
